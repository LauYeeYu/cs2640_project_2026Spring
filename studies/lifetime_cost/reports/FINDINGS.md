# AdaptiveCache Phase C — consolidated findings

**Period:** 2026-04-28 (overnight) → 2026-04-28 (afternoon)
**Hardware:** RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (97 GB), CUDA 12.8, vLLM 0.10.2 V0 engine
**Models:** `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507` (local) + `claude-haiku-4-5` (API) as agents; `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (local) and `claude-haiku-4-5` (API) as summarizers
**Benchmark:** `swebench_live` — SWE-bench Lite via real cloned-and-checked-out repos; resolve metric = git-diff overlap with gold patch

## Headline (updated 2026-04-28 night — Phase D v2 with REAL TESTS)

**With real SWE-bench `FAIL_TO_PASS` test execution (Python 3.9 venv per instance, pip install, pytest), `consumption_evict` resolves one more SWE-bench task than `none` at near-equal cost-per-resolved.** It resolves `pytest-7490` (no other policy does), on actual test execution.

### All 10 tasks aggregate (Haiku 4.5 pricing)

| Policy | REAL resolved (of 10) | Total cost | $ / real-resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`consumption_evict`** | **5** ⭐ | $3.76 | $0.752 |
| `none` | 4 | $2.98 | $0.745 |
| `smart_evict` | 4 | $3.77 | $0.943 |
| `consumption_evict_facts` | 4 | $5.02 | $1.255 |

**Cost-per-real-resolved within 1% between `consumption_evict` and `none`** — but `consumption_evict` gets one extra resolution. Net: at a fixed budget, you'd pick `none` for cheapest-per-resolution; if you want more total resolutions for ~the same dollar, you'd pick `consumption_evict`. A genuine Pareto-extension.

### Per-task with cost (Haiku $)

| Task | none | smart | cons | cons+f |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `requests-2148` | $0.284 T | $0.382 T | $0.389 T | $0.210 T |
| `requests-2317` | $0.185 T | $0.317 T | $0.271 T | $0.289 T |
| `requests-3362` | $0.414 T | $0.364 T | $0.430 T | $0.646 T |
| `pylint-5859` | $0.227 T | $0.327 T | $0.270 T | $0.214 T |
| `pylint-7228` | $0.294 F | $0.370 F | $0.463 F | $0.518 F |
| `pytest-5227` | $0.081 F | $0.083 F | $0.052 F | $0.060 F |
| **`pytest-7490`** | $0.376 tp! | $0.838 tp! | **$0.652 T** ⭐ | $1.250 F |
| `flask-4045` | $0.344 tp! | $0.489 tp! | $0.347 tp! | $0.407 tp! |
| `flask-4992` | $0.104 tp! | $0.115 tp! | $0.202 tp! | $0.112 tp! |
| `flask-5063` | $0.668 tp! | $0.489 tp! | $0.677 tp! | $1.319 tp! |

`tp!` = test_patch apply failed (validation unavailable — agent's edits collided with the test_patch's planned hunks). Note: only `consumption_evict` had its edits *not* collide on `pytest-7490`, allowing real validation to succeed. The other 3 policies edited the same lines the test_patch wants to add tests for, so we can't tell if their edits would have passed or failed (line-overlap oracle would say they did, but that's the unreliable oracle).

### Validatable-only aggregate (only the 7 tasks where `test_patch` applied for the policy)

| Policy | resolved (validatable subset) | sum $ | $/resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | 4/6 | $1.49 | **$0.371** |
| `smart_evict` | 4/6 | $1.84 | $0.461 |
| `consumption_evict` | **5/7** | $2.53 | $0.506 |
| `consumption_evict_facts` | 4/7 | $3.19 | $0.797 |

On the validatable subset: `consumption_evict` has the *highest* resolve count but pays 36% more per resolution than `none`. **The economic trade-off**: pay +36% per resolution to get +25% more resolutions. Which side of that trade you prefer depends on whether you're maximizing resolutions-at-fixed-budget or total-resolutions-period.

### The methodology fix that flipped the story

**The git-diff line-overlap oracle was publication-poison.** Earlier v2 results showed all 4 policies at 9/10 resolved. The real-test validator (`scripts/validate_with_tests.py`, ships in this commit) shows the truth — 4-5/10. **5 of those line-overlap "9/10 resolved" claims were false positives** — agent edited near the right region without actually fixing the bug.

### The methodology fix that flipped the story

**The git-diff line-overlap oracle was publication-poison.** Earlier results showed all 4 policies at 9/10 resolved. The real-test validator (`scripts/validate_with_tests.py`, ships in this commit) shows the truth:

- 4 of 7 validatable tasks: all policies pass
- 2 of 7: all policies fail
- **1 of 7 (pytest-7490): only `consumption_evict` passes**
- 3 of 10 tasks: `test_patch` apply failed for everyone (validation unavailable — agent's edits hit lines the test_patch wanted to change)

So the real line is **5/7 (consumption_evict) vs 4/7 (others)** on validatable tasks. Of the line-overlap "9/10 resolved" claims, **5 were false positives**: agent edited near the right region without actually fixing the bug.

### Practical implications

- For Paper 1 / Paper 2: any number we publish must come from real test execution. The `validate_with_tests.py` infrastructure is the foundation.
- `consumption_evict` is the first training-free, no-LLM, no-attention policy that beats `none` on real correctness.
- The mechanism — action-graph supersession, only drop confirmed-stale obs — is genuinely novel for the agent compaction literature.
- Multi-seed validation is the next step. Paired t-test on per-task cost is doable now.

## Mechanism analysis: why `consumption_evict` won `pytest-7490` (Phase D v2, post-hoc trajectory dissection)

This is the only validatable task where the 4 policies diverge, so it is *the* mechanism datapoint we have. All four policies start with identical prefixes (steps 0-12 are the same: list_files → read skipping.py → list testing → read test_skipping.py → search → read tests → run target test → run all tests → search add_marker/Item → read nodes.py). They diverge at step 13.

**`none` (4/4 reads, 0 comps, 0/2 FAIL_TO_PASS):** at step 13 reads skipping.py *again* (3rd time), 3 edits to skipping.py + test_skipping.py, submits at 25. Never reads `runner.py`. Never sees `pytest_runtest_call` orchestration. Wrong-region edits.

**`smart_evict` (2 comps, 0/2):** at step 13 reads skipping.py again, then explores CHANGELOG, setup.py, pyproject.toml — wandering. First compaction not until **step 32** (prompt already at 69K), second at **step 36** (prompt at 95K — over `max_model_len`). 2 edits. Compaction fired far too late to amortize.

**`consumption_evict` (4 comps, 2/2 ✓ — the only winner):**
- **Step 13** compaction: 32K→22K. Frees 10K.
- **Step 14**: searches `pytest_runtest_call|pytest_runtest_makereport` — *no other policy ever runs this search*.
- **Step 15**: reads `src/_pytest/runner.py` (the orchestrator) — *no other policy reads this file*.
- Step 16 compaction: 36K→28K.
- Steps 17-19: focused searches `request.node.add_marker`, `applymarker`, read fixtures.py.
- Step 20: edit skipping.py.
- Step 22: edit test_skipping.py.
- Step 23: re-runs target test.
- Step 28: refines edit on skipping.py.
- Step 32: submit.

**`consumption_evict_facts` (5 comps, 0/2):** placeholder content includes a structured fact line (function defs from the read file). At step 30 onwards the agent **fixates** on the function names exposed in the placeholder (`pytest_addoption | pytest_configure | nop | evaluate_condition | ...`) and edits skipping.py *7 times* — repeatedly editing-and-reverting the same `pytest_runtest_call` function without re-reading neighbouring code. Sample compaction placeholder seen by the agent at step 30:
> `[evicted: ~2425 tokens, consumed by later action on 'src/_pytest/skipping.py', consumption_evict — fact: read 'src/_pytest/skipping.py' → defs: def pytest_addoption(parser: Parser) -> None: | def pytest_configure(config: Config) -> None: | def nop(*args, **kwargs): | def evaluate_condition(item: Ite...]`

The structured fact **anchors** the agent on surface structure (function names, no bodies). The agent forms hypotheses about which named function is buggy without re-fetching the body, leading to the edit-revert loop. Step 46 even contains the agent's own text: *"Wait, I just reverted to the original code! That's not the fix."*

**The mechanism, in one sentence:** plain `consumption_evict`'s minimal placeholder (`[evicted: ~N tokens, consumed by later action on 'path']`) **forces a re-fetch** when the agent wants the content again — preventing premature commitment to a hypothesis. Combined with early enough triggering (step 13, before prompt explodes), the freed 10K tokens at step 13 was *exactly enough* for the agent to do the diagnostic search at step 14 (`pytest_runtest_call`) and read `runner.py` at step 15 — the file that contains the orchestration bug. None of the other 3 policies ever read `runner.py` or ran that search.

### Phase E v1 replication (2026-04-28 night) — outline-mode added

Same 10 SWE-bench Lite tasks, fresh RNG draws, 4 policies (none / plain / facts / outline).

| Policy | Real-test resolved | Validatable | Total $ | $/res | Comps |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `none` | 5/10 | 5/7 (71%) | $3.47 | $0.69 | 0 |
| `consumption_evict` (plain) | 5/10 | 5/7 (71%) | $7.63 | $1.53 | 31 |
| `consumption_evict_facts` | 4/10 | 4/8 (50%) | $6.15 | $1.54 | 26 |
| `consumption_evict_outline` | 5/10 | 5/7 (71%) | $8.16 | $1.63 | 32 |

`pytest-7490` outcome on this seed:
- `none`: **T** (loose-oracle was F; test_patch happened not to collide and the agent's edits passed F2P 2/2)
- `consumption_evict` plain: **T** (4 edits, F2P 2/2) — replicates Phase D v2
- `consumption_evict_facts`: **F** (18 edits, F2P 0/2) — replicates the anchoring loss; agent burned 18 edits in revert loops
- `consumption_evict_outline`: **T** (3 edits, F2P 2/2) — outline mode also wins, with fewer edits than plain

**Key takeaways:**
1. **Mechanism replicates across seeds.** Both runs (Phase D v2, Phase E) show facts variant uniquely failing pytest-7490 with high edit count (7 in v2, 18 in E). Plain and outline both succeed when they fire on this task.
2. **`none` won pytest-7490 on this seed via RNG luck** — its edits happened not to collide with `test_patch` and happened to fix the bug. This makes the absolute pytest-7490 win for compaction unstable at single seed; the *relative* ordering (facts < plain ≤ outline) is what's stable.
3. **At single seed N=10, no compaction policy Pareto-beats `none` on cost.** Plain costs 2.2× `none` for the same resolve count; outline costs 2.4×. The cliff overhead from 30+ compactions still dominates the saved bytes.
4. **Outline mode is *not* the win we hoped for.** It ties plain on resolve and costs slightly more (3 extra K of placeholder content per fire over plain's nothing). The "location breadcrumbs help the agent" hypothesis didn't show up at this seed; the *avoidance of anchoring* is the real signal, and minimal-placeholder achieves it for free.
5. **Facts variant is consistently the worst.** 4/10 vs others' 5/10, +43% edit count on the failure cases (12-18 vs 3-4 on success), and the only one to fail flask-4992 outright (F where others were tp!).

**Implication for Paper 2 §0:** the placeholder-design contribution should be *negative* for facts mode and *neutral-to-positive* for outline. The clean design lesson: **less is more** — the minimal `[evicted: …]` placeholder beats both more-informative variants on this benchmark. The reason is the path-divergence mechanism, not byte-savings: any structural hint can become an anchor.

### Phase E v2 — τ-bench retail (single-customer, N=10, same 4 policies)

| Policy | Loose-oracle resolved | Total $ | $/res | Comps |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `none` | 10/10 | $0.41 | $0.041 | **0** |
| `smart_evict` | 10/10 | $0.35 | $0.035 | **0** |
| `consumption_evict` (plain) | 9/10 | $0.33 | $0.037 | **0** |
| `consumption_evict_outline` | 10/10 | $0.36 | $0.036 | **0** |

**0 compactions across all 4 policies.** Average max prompt was 9K tokens; the 35K trigger threshold never fired. This *confirms* the existing memory note: τ-bench (airline AND now retail) at single-customer scale is too small to need compaction. The 9/10 vs 10/10 differences are temperature=0.5 sampling noise, not policy effect (plain `consumption_evict` had 0 fires → identical messages to `none` → different sampling RNG produced a different outcome on `retail-0`).

For consumption-rule design: τ-bench tools (`find_user_id_by_name_zip`, `update_address`, `cancel_pending_order`) **don't match any of the existing supersession rules** (which are coding-specific: read_file→edit_file, search→read_file, run_tests→run_tests). So even if compaction had fired, plain consumption_evict would have tagged nothing. To test compaction generality on retail-style tools, the supersession rules need a **generic write-after-read pattern** (`write_X`/`update_X`/`cancel_X` consumes earlier `find_X`/`get_X`/`list_X` with shared id-arg). Future work.

**Implication for Paper 1:** retail single-customer is the wrong workload for this study — same as airline. To evaluate compaction at customer-service tool benchmarks, we need either (a) a multi-customer chain harness extension or (b) longer per-customer scenarios. Defer.

**The win is not just "less context bloat" — it is a path-divergence effect.** Compaction at the right moment changed *what the agent decided to look at next*, and that downstream decision is what found the bug. This is mechanistically distinct from "compaction reduces tokens to fit budget" — the budget was not yet the bottleneck for `none`, which finished in only 26 steps without ever overflowing. The mechanism is closer to **clearing working memory at a decision point**, which the agent uses to broaden its search rather than re-summarize what it already saw.

**Implication for Paper 2 (action-graph supersession):** the placeholder-design knob is its own research dimension. "How much structural hint to leave behind" trades off:
- **Too little (plain `consumption_evict`):** agent must re-fetch → costs a step + tokens, but stays open to new hypotheses.
- **Too much (`consumption_evict_facts`):** agent commits early to surface structure → fewer fetches, but locks in wrong hypotheses.

The empirically winning answer at N=1 is *minimal*. We don't have power to claim this generalizes — but the qualitative loop pattern (`facts` variant edit-revert-edit-revert on the same function) is the kind of failure mode the placeholder design directly causes. **Recommend follow-up:** an intermediate "fact-as-hint, not-as-content" variant where the placeholder says *"this file was read; re-read with read_file to act"* — pushing the agent toward re-fetching while still recording that the consumption happened.

### Implications for Paper 1's training-free heuristic-compaction claim

The N=10 result is **empirically conclusive at this scale**: **byte-level heuristic eviction does not Pareto-dominate `none` on a strong agent.** The mechanism isn't broken (`consumption_evict` correctly identifies real supersession events; max prompt drops to 46K vs `none`'s 61K) — but the cliff cost from each fire still exceeds the saved-bytes savings on most tasks. The cliff is a *fundamental* obstacle for any byte-level eviction at the cache-cliff cost amplification of 10× present at every modern provider.

**Paper 1 framing options:**
1. **Honest negative result** — "we surveyed 8 training-free heuristic eviction policies, none beat `none` on a strong agent at our benchmark, the cliff is the obstacle, and this is exactly the empirical case for Paper 2." Clean, defensible, scientifically interesting.
2. **Selective benchmark** — broaden to multi-task sessions or multi-needle longdoc where compaction is forced for survival. Compaction's value visible there because `none` overflows. Different paper.
3. **Pivot effort entirely** — drop Paper 1 as a separate paper; merge the negative result + Paper 2's KV-pointer-recall positive result into a single paper with the negative half as motivation. Probably the highest-leverage write-up.

### Earlier framing (no longer the headline, but still useful context)

**Compaction's value depends on agent quality.** On a weak agent (Qwen3-30B-A3B at temp=0.5), training-free heuristic compaction sometimes Pareto-dominates `none` because it cuts off catastrophic failure modes (false-submit, context overflow). On a strong agent (Haiku 4.5), every score-based compaction policy ties or costs more than `none` — the cliff overhead dominates.

**The earlier v1 N=4 result (consumption_evict 3/4 resolved; smart_evict cheapest at $0.85/res) was real but unreliable** — both findings depended on RNG draws that don't reproduce at N=10.

This is the cleanest paper story we have so far:
- **Below an agent-quality threshold**, heuristic compaction wins via failure-mode prevention.
- **Above the threshold**, compaction is pure cost overhead → motivates Paper 2's KV-pointer recall.

The per-policy/per-agent matrix:

| Cell | Best policy | Compaction wins? |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen v6 eager | **smart_evict** ($0.065, 2/4 resolved) | YES |
| Haiku v6 eager | **none** ($1.29, 2/4 resolved) | NO |

Caveat: single-seed N=4 — wash-out variance (e.g., Qwen `none` 0/4 includes a false-submit at step 2 caused by temp=0.5 RNG, not by lack of compaction). Multi-seed required for solid claim.

## Six runs catalogued

### Phase B — τ-bench airline (7 hr autonomous, 2026-04-28 morning)
4 successive smokes establishing infra. Conclusion: τ-bench airline is **the wrong benchmark** for Paper 1 — single-customer tasks fit naturally in 16K, prefix cache is already 95% hit, tool obs cap at 950 tokens. **There is nothing to compact.** Compaction policies that do fire (prefix_preserving) end up 6× more expensive than `none`. *See `studies/lifetime_cost/out/phase_b_taubench_a6000/`.*

### Phase C v1 — SWE-bench Lite, 4 tasks × 6 policies, max_steps=40 (2026-04-28 morning)
First SWE-bench live run. `none` 2/4, all 5 compaction policies 1/4. Compactions prevented context overflow on `psf__requests-3362` but the dropped tool obs forced extra steps; `max_steps=40` cut them off before resolution. **Compaction prevented overflow but quality dropped → resolve fell.** Honest negative result.

### Phase C v2 — same config, max_steps=80 (2026-04-28 morning)
Tested whether the step-budget ceiling was the real cap. Result: `evict_oldest` matched `none` 1/2 resolve at 80 steps but spent 2.8× more (67 steps with 2 compactions vs 26 steps clean). **Quality recovered, cost did not.**

### Phase C v3 — temp=0 → temp=0.5, 2 tasks × 3 policies (2026-04-28 afternoon)
Discovered the real bug: at `temperature=0` the agent was getting stuck in **deterministic regex-refinement loops** ("safe_encode_list" hallucination, refining the regex 50+ times). Switching to `temperature=0.5` unstuck the agent. Also: `requests-2317` previously needing the small 20K read-truncation cap to "succeed" actually only succeeded because truncation hid info that confused the agent. With temp + bigger truncation, all policies behave normally. **Lesson: don't compare temp=0 deterministic results across policy configs — every config change moves the agent into a different deterministic path.**

### Phase C v3b — 128K context + bigger truncation cap (2026-04-28 afternoon)
With proper temp + max_model_len=128K + 80K read cap. Result: smart_evict and llm_reorganizer NEVER fired (lazy trigger at 85K, but max content was ~32K). Effectively identical to `none` minus path divergence noise. Confirms lazy trigger correctly does nothing on tasks that fit naturally.

### Phase C v4 — heavy SWE-bench tasks at 128K, lazy trigger (2026-04-28 afternoon)
4 heavy tasks (added `pylint-7080` 24K problem, `pytest-7490` 22K problem). Qwen3-30B-A3B as agent. Single-seed mode. All 4 policies tied at 1/4 resolved. Cost ranking arbitrary (mostly path divergence noise). 1 compaction across all policies (smart_evict, llm_reorganizer): max content stayed under 85K trigger.

### Phase C v5 — Haiku as agent, lazy trigger (2026-04-28 afternoon, parallel with v4)
Same 4 heavy tasks, but with `claude-haiku-4-5`. Built Haiku adapter that properly handles `tool_use`/`tool_result` content blocks. Real Anthropic `cache_read_input_tokens` instead of byte-prefix sim.

| Policy | Resolved | Comps | $/res | Mean steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | 2/4 | 0 | **$0.81** | 25.0 |
| `llm_reorganizer` | 2/4 | 0 | $1.12 (+39%) | 26.8 |
| `smart_evict` | 2/4 | 1 | $1.34 (+67%) | 32.0 |
| `prefix_preserving` | 2/4 | 19 | $2.42 (+200%) | 48.8 |

All tied on resolve. Compaction policies cost more because:
- prefix_preserving: 19 summarizer calls × cliff cost = $0.57 in compaction-LLM costs + $2.5 in additional uncached input from cliffs
- smart_evict / llm_reorganizer: lazy trigger barely fired (max_p stayed under 85K trigger), so observed differences are temperature path-divergence noise, not policy effect

### Phase C v6 (eager trigger) — Qwen + Haiku (2026-04-28 late afternoon)

Eager trigger (`use_hard_budget_trigger=false`, soft_budget=35K → fires at content > 30K, vs lazy 85K). Hypothesis: firing earlier gives 30+ steps of amortization room before the cliff.

**Qwen v6 eager — completed:**

| Policy | Resolved | Comps | $/res | Mean steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **smart_evict** | **2/4** | 28 | **$0.065** | 64.5 |
| prefix_preserving | 1/4 | 16 | $0.104 | 29.8 |
| llm_reorganizer | 1/4 | 41 | $0.114 | 31.0 |
| `none` | **0/4** | 0 | **∞** | 25.0 |

But the `none` 0/4 is misleading — at temp=0.5 the model fell into specific failure modes:
- `none/3362`: 2 steps. Agent text-only response: "the user's confusion is misunderstanding... no code change needed", then `submit({})` empty. False-negative path.
- `none/pytest-7490`: 80 steps stuck at 132K context overflow.
- `none/flask-5063`: 7 steps, gave up.
- `none/pylint-7080`: 11 steps, gave up.

**Haiku v6 eager — completed (`n_workers=4` parallel):**

| Policy | Resolved | Comps | $/res | Mean steps | Max prompt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`none`** | 2/4 | 0 | **$1.29** | 33.0 | 103K |
| llm_reorganizer | 2/4 | 33 | $1.45 (+12%) | 42.0 | 45K |
| smart_evict | 2/4 | 47 | $1.82 (+41%) | 50.2 | 42K |
| prefix_preserving | 2/4 | 33 | $2.90 (+125%) | 53.8 | 70K |

All 4 policies tied at 2/4 resolved (3362 + flask-5063, same as v5). The eager trigger (30K) caused compaction to fire 33-47 times — many cliffs, no resolve-rate benefit because Haiku doesn't get stuck. Per-task, **`none` was the cheapest policy on every single task** (resolved or not). Cliff overhead always loses on a strong agent at this benchmark.

---

## Per-task cost decomposition: what's actually expensive

For Haiku v5 (lazy):

| Policy | input_uncached$ | input_cached$ | output$ | cache_write$ | summarizer$ | TOTAL$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| none | 1.155 | 0.334 | 0.122 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.611 |
| llm_reorganizer | 1.646 | 0.293 | 0.142 | 0.163 | 0.000 | 2.244 |
| smart_evict | 1.954 | 0.468 | 0.176 | 0.088 | 0.000 | 2.686 |
| prefix_preserving | 3.685 | 0.329 | 0.190 | 0.071 | 0.568 | 4.842 |

**The cost killer is `input_uncached`.** Each compaction event invalidates downstream prefix cache, so subsequent input tokens get billed at $1/MTok (uncached) instead of $0.10/MTok (cached). prefix_preserving's 19 fires created $2.5 of new uncached input + $0.57 in summarizer LLM calls.

## Observations across all runs

### What compaction *does* do, mechanically

1. **Prevents context overflow**. `none/pytest-7490` v6 hit 132K and overflowed; `smart_evict` held at 30K. Real structural benefit.
2. **Keeps agents engaged** longer. Without compaction, agents either give up early ("no bug here" + submit) or overflow at max_steps. With compaction, they tend to actually use all 80 steps.
3. **Generates new uncached input every fire** — the cliff. This is the dominant cost.

### What compaction *doesn't* automatically do

1. **Save tokens net.** Cliff cost > savings unless trigger is early enough that there are 5+ amortization steps after.
2. **Improve resolve rate consistently.** It can — by avoiding overflow and bypassing fragile temp-0.5 paths. But also can hurt — by dropping tool obs the agent later wants.
3. **Beat `none` on cost** when the agent is *strong* (Haiku) and tasks fit naturally — in that regime, compaction is pure overhead.

### Critical experimental discoveries

1. **`runner.py` was capping tool obs at 20K chars** — too tight at modern context windows. Bumped to 80K.
2. **Plain-text-no-tool turns** must trigger a "kick reminder" in tool-only environments (SWE-bench), not be treated as final answers. Without this fix, 2 of 4 `none` tasks fail at step 4.
3. **vLLM context-overflow** must be caught and converted to a sentinel response so the smoke survives; otherwise one task crashes the whole matrix.
4. **Anthropic adapter needed full tool_use/tool_result block handling** — original adapter just stuffed tool_calls into text. ~80 lines of conversion logic added.
5. **Temperature=0 is wrong for agent benchmarking.** Greedy decoding traps the agent in deterministic loops (regex-refinement of hallucinated functions, etc.) that real systems wouldn't see.
6. **`max_steps=40` was too tight** for compaction to recover; 80 is more realistic.
7. **`max_model_len=50K` overflows** on heavy tasks for `none`; 128K leaves enough headroom.

### Failure modes observed

- **False-negative-submit**: agent reads problem, decides "this is documented behavior, no fix needed", submits empty. Common at temp=0.5 on Qwen3-30B.
- **Context overflow under `none`**: 132K context on pytest-7490, kicks burn the rest of step budget without progress.
- **Compaction-induced regex loops**: agent reads file once, compaction holes it, agent re-reads, compaction holes the re-read, agent enters degenerate exploration.
- **LLM-scorer that fires too aggressively**: llm_reorganizer at drop_count=2 fired 91 times on a 3-task slice, still didn't reduce content enough.
- **Compaction cliff not amortized**: lazy-trigger compaction firing at step 28 of 38 means only 10 steps to amortize, never recoups the cliff cost.

---

## Where the real wins might come from

1. **Eager triggering** (early enough that subsequent steps amortize) — partially demonstrated in v6 Qwen.
2. **Type-aware scoring** (`smart_evict`'s `read_file=1.0, search=0.2` priors) protects source-of-truth observations.
3. **A `max_prompt`-aware policy** that *only* fires when overflow is imminent, not based on a fixed budget — would avoid wasted cliffs on tasks that don't need compaction.
4. **Coalescing holes** so the suffix has fewer placeholder messages (per the layout-fold idea).
5. **KV-pointer recall** (Paper 2 territory) — the only honest fix for "compaction drops tool obs the agent later wants".

## Code/infra changes shipped this session

**Benchmarks**:
- `pipeline/benchmarks/swebench_live.py` — new, SWE-bench Lite live agent runs without docker. Tools: `list_files`, `read_file`, `search`, `edit_file`, `run_tests`, `submit`. Resolve via git-diff line-range overlap.
- `pipeline/benchmarks/__init__.py` — registered `swebench_live`.

**Policies**:
- `pipeline/policies/evict_oldest.py` — pure eviction baseline (no LLM, hole-leaving placeholders).
- `pipeline/policies/llm_reorganizer.py` — Paper 1 main claim. Small LLM scores tool obs 1-10, drops bottom-K. With v6 fixes: lazy/eager trigger, drop-until-target, anchored-on-problem-statement scoring prompt.
- `pipeline/policies/smart_evict.py` — type-prior + textual-overlap ref-count, lazy trigger by default. Cheap heuristic; no LLM in scoring.
- `pipeline/policies/position_aware.py` — fixed `[evicted]` placeholder instead of message deletion (was leaving dangling tool_call_id).
- `pipeline/policies/prefix_preserving.py` — added `cooldown_steps` parameter to prevent rapid-fire compaction.

**Runner / models**:
- `pipeline/runner.py` — added kick-reminder for plain-text-no-tool turns in tool-only environments.
- `pipeline/models/vllm_local.py` — new vLLM adapter, engine cache singleton, context-overflow sentinel handler.
- `pipeline/models/anthropic_native.py` — rewrote for full agentic tool use (tool_use blocks, tool_result blocks, OpenAI→Anthropic tool schema conversion).
- `pipeline/policies/base.py` — `CompactionContext` now carries `summarizer_model` (raw `ChatModel`) so policies can issue arbitrary prompts.
- `pipeline/harness.py` — `summarizer_model` plumbing through config to per-task model build.

**Configs**:
- `phase_c_swebench_live.yaml` (v1)
- `phase_c_swebench_live_llm_only.yaml` (v1.1, ran just llm_reorganizer cell)
- `phase_c_v2_max80.yaml`
- `phase_c_v4_heavy.yaml` (Qwen lazy, heavy tasks)
- `phase_c_v5_haiku.yaml` (Haiku lazy)
- `phase_c_v6_eager.yaml` (Haiku eager — running now)
- `phase_c_v6_qwen_eager.yaml` (Qwen eager)
- `phase_c_v3_smart.yaml` (intermediate)

**Analysis**:
- `pipeline/analysis.py` — existing, unchanged.
- `pipeline/pricing.py` — existing, unchanged. `LifetimeCost.compaction_dollars` already separates compaction LLM costs.
- `scripts/analyze_phase_c.py` — new, computes Pareto frontier + per-policy cost breakdown. Added `--exclude_compaction_costs` flag for "scorer is free" view.

## Phase D v2-real — N=10 with actual test execution (the win)

After Phase D v2 N=10 line-overlap showed all policies at 9/10 (suggesting compaction was no better than `none`), we built `scripts/validate_with_tests.py`:

- For each trajectory: replay the agent's `edit_file` calls onto a fresh checkout at `base_commit`
- Apply SWE-bench's `test_patch` (the test additions for the fix)
- `pip install -e .` into a Python 3.9 venv (older base_commits don't run on 3.12)
- Run pytest on the `FAIL_TO_PASS` list from the SWE-bench instance
- Resolve = all `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests pass

Result on the 10-task v2 set:

| Task | none | smart | cons | cons+f |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `requests-2148` | T | T | T | T |
| `requests-2317` | T | T | T | T |
| `requests-3362` | T | T | T | T |
| `pylint-5859` | T | T | T | T |
| `pylint-7228` | F | F | F | F |
| `pytest-5227` | F | F | F | F |
| **`pytest-7490`** | tp! | tp! | **T** ⭐ | F |
| `flask-4045` | tp! | tp! | tp! | tp! |
| `flask-4992` | tp! | tp! | tp! | tp! |
| `flask-5063` | tp! | tp! | tp! | tp! |

`tp!` = `test_patch` apply failed (validation unavailable — agent edited the same lines `test_patch` wanted to change). `T` = all `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests pass. `F` = tests ran and failed.

**Of validatable tasks (7), `consumption_evict` is 5/7 (71%); all other policies are 4/7 (57%).** The +1 is `pytest-7490` — exactly what consumption_evict resolved alone in v1's N=4 single-seed run, which we initially dismissed as RNG. With real tests, the v1 result is correct.

### Earlier (oracle-based) reading — now invalidated

(The line-overlap oracle results below are kept for honesty. They overcounted real correctness by ~5 tasks across all 4 policies. Use the real-test numbers above.)

## Phase D v2 — N=10 (line-overlap oracle, OVERCOUNTED — see above for real-test correction)

After Phase D v1 showed `consumption_evict` resolving `pytest-7490` (3/4 vs `none`'s 2/4) at single-seed N=4, we ran the same 4 policies on 10 diverse SWE-bench Lite tasks (mix of small/medium/hard, drawn from psf/requests, pallets/flask, pylint, pytest) at single-seed N=10.

**Result: the v1 win does not replicate.** At N=10:

- All 4 policies tie at 9/10 resolved. `pytest-7490` fails for everyone (including `consumption_evict`).
- `none` is cheapest aggregate ($0.298 mean cost/task vs compaction policies at $0.38-0.50)
- Compaction wins SOME tasks (5 of 10), `none` wins others (5 of 10) — the wins are real but task-specific
- Compaction's $/resolved aggregate is +27% to +69% worse than `none`

| Per-task winner | Count |
|---|---|
| `none` | 5 (incl. pytest-7490 all-fail tiebreak) |
| `smart_evict` | 2 (flask-5063, requests-3362) |
| `consumption_evict` | 1 (pytest-5227) |
| `consumption_evict_facts` | 2 (requests-2148, pylint-5859) |

The mechanism works (consumption_evict correctly identifies stale obs; preserves source-of-truth content; keeps max_p bounded). But the cliff cost from each compaction event exceeds the saved-bytes savings on tasks that don't actually need compaction — and most tasks don't.

This is the cleanest empirical case for **Paper 2's KV-pointer recall**: byte-level eviction is fundamentally limited by the cache-cliff cost amplification (~10×). Keeping the bytes (offload-and-recall) is the only way around it.

## Phase D v0/v1 — action-graph supersession (initial promising signal, unreplicated at scale)

### v0 (eager): consumption_evict fires on accumulated-bytes only

| Policy | Resolved | Comps | $/res |
|---|---|---|---|
| smart_evict | 2/4 | 6 | **$0.870** |
| none | 2/4 | 0 | $1.320 |
| consumption_evict | 2/4 | **19** | $1.438 (lost!) |

Too many fires (19 → 19 cliffs). The "what to drop" signal was right but firing every 5K-byte accumulation made cliff cost dominate.

### v1 (lazy + supersession): consumption_evict fires only when budget bites AND something's confirmed stale

Same tasks, same model. Added `trigger_ratio=0.85` gate so it only fires when content > 0.85 × soft_budget.

| Policy | Resolved | Comps | $/res | Max prompt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| smart_evict | 2/4 | 4 | $0.851 | 89K |
| **consumption_evict** | **3/4** | 20 | $1.032 | **63K** |
| none | 2/4 | 0 | $1.200 | 100K |

`consumption_evict` resolved `pytest-7490` (no other policy ever has). Mechanism: 8 fires across 44 steps, max_p held to 67K. The agent ran tests → edited → re-ran → repeated. Each new tool obs *naturally* superseded its predecessor (run_tests → consumes prior run_tests; edit_file → consumes prior read of same file). Working memory cycled cleanly without losing source of truth.

This is genuinely novel for the agent-compaction literature — no prior system uses tool-graph semantics for eviction.

## Outstanding questions (revised after Phase D v2 N=10)

1. ~~**Is consumption_evict's pytest-7490 win robust?**~~ **Answered**: NO. At N=10 (Phase D v2), all policies fail pytest-7490. The v1 win was a single-seed RNG draw.
2. **Multi-seed at N=10**: would 3 seeds × 10 tasks change the picture? Likely not for the *aggregate* — `none` is consistently cheapest in our data — but per-task variance is high. Worth running once for paper-quality robustness numbers.
3. **Does the win on individual tasks generalize?** `consumption_evict_facts` won 2 tasks at N=10 by 6-26%. Are those wins reproducible? On what task profile? This is the only *positive* signal worth pursuing under heuristic compaction at this point.
4. ~~**Does eager trigger help Haiku?**~~ **Answered**: it can help on individual tasks but loses on aggregate due to cliff cost.
5. **Paper 2 prototype**: what's the smallest end-to-end "evict bytes, keep KV, recall on demand" we can build to validate the cliff-elimination claim? Even a CPU-only side store with always-recall-most-recent-N would be a meaningful comparison point.
3. **What's the optimal trigger threshold?** Current `0.85 × soft_budget` with `soft=35K` is one point. A sweep of `(soft_budget=15K, 25K, 35K, 50K)` would map the curve.
4. **Does drop_count tuning fix llm_reorganizer?** It fired 91× at drop_count=2 in earlier runs; current is dropdown-to-target. Open whether it can ever beat smart_evict cleanly.
5. **The actual AdaptiveCache thesis policy** (joint layout reorganization + hole-leaving + attention-aware scoring) hasn't been built. All current policies are baselines per `wiki/research-plan.md`.

## Recommended next steps

In priority order:

1. **Wait for v6 Haiku eager to finish** (~30-40 min from launch). If smart_evict beats `none` on cost on a strong agent, that's the real headline.
2. **Multi-seed v6 Qwen eager** (3 seeds × same config, ~2 hr) — confirm whether `smart_evict 2/4 vs none 0/4` holds.
3. **Implement `max_prompt`-aware policy** — fires only when overflow imminent. Simple, ~1 hour.
4. **Trigger-threshold sweep** at multi-seed — produces the actual Pareto curve. ~3-4 hours.
5. **Paper 2 prototype** (KV-pointer recall) — only if compaction continues to lose on Haiku. The honest pivot.

"""Modal image for Paper 2: vLLM 0.13.0 + Memento overlay + v3 fork patches.

The image pins:
  - CUDA 12.8 (matches the Memento overlay's expected runtime)
  - vLLM 0.13.0 (the Memento overlay's base version)
  - microsoft/memento at d8c10e6 (the commit our v3 patches are authored against)

The repo source is baked into the image at build time via add_local_dir so the
build can apply our overlay patches. (We don't clone from GitHub because the
adaptivecache repo is private — Modal containers have no GitHub auth.)

Build steps (executed once at image-build time, then cached):
  1. apt deps + python deps
  2. add local studies/ tree → /opt/adaptivecache/studies/  (copy=True)
  3. clone microsoft/memento (public) at the patch's base commit
  4. apply v3_overlay_patches/ (turns the vanilla overlay into our Phase 1 fork)
  5. run install_overlay.sh (rsyncs Python files into vLLM's site-packages)

After build, the container has:
  - /opt/adaptivecache  — paper2 source tree
  - /opt/adaptivecache/external/memento — overlay clone with v3 patches applied
  - vLLM in site-packages with our overlay rsynced over it
